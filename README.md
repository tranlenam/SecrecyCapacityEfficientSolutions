# On the Secrecy Capacity of MIMO Wiretap Channels: Convex Reformulation and Efficient Numerical Methods

This repo is cloned from [this CodeOcean capsule](https://codeocean.com/capsule/6999418/tree/v1), which contains the code for the following scientific paper:

Anshu Mukherjee, Bj√∂rn Ottersten, and Le-Nam Tran, "On the Secrecy Capacity of MIMO Wiretap Channels: Convex Reformulation and Efficient Numerical Methods,"  IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 6865-6878, Oct. 2021.

## Instructions
"**Fig1a.m**" and "**Fig1b.m**" reproduce Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively, and **Fig2.m** reproduces Fig. 2.

The code relies on [Yalmip](https://yalmip.github.io/) as a parser and [SDPT3](https://github.com/sqlp/sdpt3) as the internal SDP solver. Code Ocean automatically provides these packages (see environment/postInstall). You can download the code and run it on your local machine, but you need to manually install these packages yourself.
